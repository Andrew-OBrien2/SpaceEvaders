# SpaceEvaders
 Endless Runner Game.
 Arrow keys for vertical and horizontal movement. Spacebar is used to teleport forward.

 The goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding colliding with enemies and asteroids, while also making sure to grab fuel for your rocketship.

 This game is unfinished, and it is not a good representation of what I wanted it to be. I spent too much time designing assets and waited too long to finish the coding side.
